# Unduly lenient sentences review scheme 'inadequate'

In July 2019 **Rob England** [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47879288) on data revealing that a third of public requests to extend "lenient" sentences are rejected because the crimes committed are not eligible for review:

> Figures obtained by the BBC under Freedom of Information laws show the unduly lenient sentence scheme received requests to increase 3,499 crown court sentences in England and Wales between 2015 and 2018.

> Only 643 of these ended up at the Court of Appeal with 478, 14% of the total, resulting in harsher punishments.

> About a third of all requests, 1,148, were dismissed outright because the crimes committed were not eligible for review - something critics say has to change.

The department had to re-release the 2016 data after some errors, so we had to combine two datasets (the one that is publicly available for that year, plus the revised FOI). There were also 30 sentences removed to avoid duplication.
