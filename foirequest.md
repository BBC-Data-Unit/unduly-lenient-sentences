# FOI request sent to the Attorney General's Office

I’d like to request some data under the Freedom of Information Act.

Could you provide me with the following details for all the applications made to the unduly lenient sentences scheme between the years 2015-2017:

Offence	| Original Sentence	| Crown Court	Sentence | considered unduly lenient by the Court? |	Outcome? |	Revised sentence
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
(Murder/Robbery etc)|	(10 years etc)|	(Sheffield or Guildford etc)	|(Yes/No/Pending)|	(Sentence changed/Sentence unchanged/Pending)|	(15 years/Pending/NA if unchanged)

Can you please include ALL applications made by members of the public, regardless of whether the application was later withdrawn, out of time, not in scheme, not referred to the court of appeal, referred to the court of appeal, under consideration or any other circumstance.

I have checked with the AG press office and spoken to staff who say the information is not publicly available – hence my request. The applications which are publicly available are only the ones which were eventually referred to the court of appeal. The reason for my request is that I would like a wider view of all applications made for a news story I am writing.
